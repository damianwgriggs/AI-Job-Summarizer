# AI Job Summarizer

This is a simple web application built with Streamlit that uses the Google Gemini API to summarize job descriptions. Users can paste a full job description into a text box, and the application will return a concise summary and a bulleted list of key qualifications.

This project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating the ability to rapidly prototype, build, and deploy a functional AI-powered tool.
